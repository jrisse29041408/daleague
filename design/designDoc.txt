Overview:
    Da League, yes the name is a working progress, is a website--future mobile
    app--for fantasy football that is tailored to the sports gambler. The idea
    of the website is that you won't have to handle collecting money each
    member of a league. Also I am not sure if this part is where I monetize the
    site. A subscription like 4.99 a month for machine/deep learning analytics
    on each player and draft assistant(just an idea I don't know if I am going
    to do this or maybe it could be a future thing if becomes a thing) that you
    can chat with.

Version Control:
    - git

Tech Stack:
    - Typescript
    - Nextjs/React
    - Postgres
        - sequalize (ORM)
    - GraphQL/Restful
        - not sure yet
    - Stripe (Payments)
    - Python
    - Flask
    - TensorFlow
    - Scikit-Learn

Servers:
    - apollo express server
    - postgres server
    - python server for machine learning analytics
    - frontend server
    - python server chatbot

Architecture:
    - the api for the chatbot and machine learning analytics would be most
      likely a restful api
        - assuming that using graphql with python would be a huge learning
          curve

Production:
    - docker
        - containers

Host:
    - netlify/aws
        - not sure yet

Data Demands:
    - Player info
    - Player stats
    - Live player game stat
    - Machine learning analysis

Concerns:
    - cost of the data requirements for a fantasy football website
    - Haven't gotten the grasp of graphql yet

Features:
    - Signing Up
        - Google, Facebook, Twitter  OAuth
        - Free to sign up

    - Creating a league
        - Choose between a free league or a betters league
            - if betters league choose the entry fee
        - Configure the league's and draft's settings

    - Ways of joining a league
        - Send a text, email or snapchat maybe
        - Searching the league
            - leageue name
            - commisioner

    - The bag
        - all of the money from each player
        - need a way to securely store the money till someone wins

    - GMs Office (page)
        - platfrom for a user can look at graphs and tables
        - will contain machine/deep learning insights

    - Draft assistant (possibly naming the bot to Al)
        - before draft will send the user articles written by football
          analyst, mock drafts predicted by machine or deep learning
        - during the draft it will give suggested pick by machine/deep learning
